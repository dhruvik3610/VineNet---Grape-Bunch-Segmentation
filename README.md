# VineNet---Grape-Bunch-Segmentation
VineNet
This repository is part of the CS671 Deep Learning Hackathon. Participants were tasked with crafting a lightweight, fast deep learning model to precisely segment grape bunches in high-resolution vineyard images.

Objectives
Model Development: Build a deep learning model capable of accurately segmenting grape bunches (semantic segmentation) in high-resolution images of vineyards.
Minimize Inference Time: Emphasize minimizing inference time to enable real-time applications in vineyard management.
Webpage Development: Develop a user-friendly webpage showcasing the practical application of the segmentation models.
Model
We trained an end-to-end U-Net architecture to identify bunches of grapes in farm images. The model was trained for 250 epochs.

Dataset
A meticulously curated training dataset containing labeled high-resolution images of grape vineyards was provided to participants.

Features
Less Inference Time: Optimized for fast inference.
Less Number of Parameters: Designed with a lightweight architecture.
Simple Architecture: Easy to understand and implement.
Results
We achieved a Training IoU of 0.96 and a Validation IoU of 0.71 by the 250th epoch.

Here is a sample image and the mask generated from our model, which will be used to identify grape bunches in the field.
